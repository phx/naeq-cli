# NAEQ-cli

This is a personal experiment that I have made public to anyone else who is interested in cryptography, as well as high strangeness and other weird topics.

It is a work in progress, and I am eventually going to add the ability to integrate with your own personal database in order to return previous search results
matching the same CEQ value, which could prove to be interesting and useful.

## Usage:

`./naeq.py [WORD/NAME/PHRASE]` or `echo [WORD/NAME/PHRASE] | ./naeq.py`

Special thanks to [Wren Collier](https://liminalroom.com/) and [Alynne Keith](https://offalynne.neocities.org/), who developed [https://www.naeq.io](https://www.naeq.io/)
and made their project available on [GitHub](https://github.com/misterapol/naeq).  [`liber_al.py`](liber_al.py) uses the NAEQ dictionary sourced straight from their own
[`data.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/misterapol/naeq/master/data.js), which was a **huge** help in the creation of this command line project, as most of the real
work had already been done.

These projects could not have been accomplished without the amazing and interesting work of Allen Greenfield and his book, **Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts**, as well as all
of the amazing and "crazy" individuals who have investigated and worked with this cipher for over a century.

Also a special shout out to [Greg and Dana Newkirk](https://weirdhq.com/) and their amazing series [Hellier](https://www.hellier.tv/), which first introduced me to this material,
as well as a friend as close as a brother, Devin, who introduced me to the series.
